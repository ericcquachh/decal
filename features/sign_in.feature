Feature: Sign in
  As a student
  So that I can facilitate a course
  I want to be able to sign in

    Scenario: User is not signed up
      Given I do not exist as a user
      When I sign in with valid credentials
      Then I see an invalid login message
      And I should be signed out

    Scenario: User signs in successfully
      Given I exist as a user
      When I sign in with valid credentials
      Then I see a successful sign in message
      When I return to the site
      Then I should be signed in

    Scenario: User enters wrong email
      Given I exist as a user
      When I sign in with a wrong email
      Then I see an invalid login message
      And I should be signed out
      
    Scenario: User enters wrong password
      Given I exist as a user
      When I sign in with a wrong password
      Then I see an invalid login message
      And I should be signed out
