Feature: Add Files to Course
	As a facilitator
	So students can view course syllabus
	I want to add a file to my course

Background: 

	Given the following users exist:
    | profile_id | email                      | name           | password     | 
    | 1          | markmiyashita@berkeley.edu | Mark Miyashita | ilovepython  | 
    | 2          | yunpark@berkeley.edu       | Yun Park       | iheartpython | 

    Given I am logged in as "yunpark@berkeley.edu" with pass "iheartpython"
	Then I press "Python on Crack"

Scenario: Successfully add file
	
	When I am on the course overview page
	And I press on â€œAdd File"
	Then I should be on the add file page
	And I add a file called "syllabus.pdf"
	And I press "Upload"
	Then I should be on the course overview page
	And I should see "syllabus.pdf"
